# Reflection Post

The December 2021 AWS outage (Giles 2022) reminded me how quickly things can go wrong when a company pins everything on a single cloud. Reading Schwab's take on Industry 4.0 (Schwab 2016) and the fog/edge ideas of Buyya and Srirama (2019) helped me see the trade‑off more clearly: the smarter and more automated we make our systems with AIOps (Cheng et al. 2023), the bigger the impact if something fundamental breaks. The episode left me both impressed by automation's potential and aware of its fragility, reinforcing the need to keep a critical, questioning mindset whenever I design or depend on complex AI‑driven operations.
