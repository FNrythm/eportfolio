# Reflection - Collaborative Discussion 3

This discussion crystallized the fundamental tension in contemporary AI development: the race between capability and accountability. The "stochastic parrots" critique (Bender et al., 2021) particularly resonated—these systems achieve remarkable performance while potentially lacking genuine understanding, creating unique ethical challenges absent in traditional software.

What struck me most was how the ethical issues compound rather than exist in isolation. Bias amplification doesn't just harm individuals; when combined with deepfakes and lack of transparency, it threatens entire information ecosystems. Peer feedback on governance tools like model cards (Mitchell et al., 2019) offered concrete pathways forward, but the discussion revealed these technical solutions require accompanying regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act to be effective.

The integration of deep learning into Industry 4.0 applications (Wang et al., 2016) highlighted a critical insight: as these systems move from experimental to embedded, the window for establishing ethical guardrails narrows. This underscores the urgency of proactive governance rather than reactive regulation after harm occurs.
