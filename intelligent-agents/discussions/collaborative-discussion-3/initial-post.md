## Ethics of Deep Learning and Generative AI

The arrival of technologies that create content using deep learning models clearly raises serious ethical issues that need to be carefully considered. Deep learning, a part of machine learning, uses complex networks to learn from huge amounts of data (Sarker, 2021), while generative AI uses these models to produce new content, like text or images, that copies the patterns it has learned. The ethical problems that come from this are complex and important.

First, models trained on huge amounts of unfiltered internet data often pick up and magnify existing biases in society, leading to harmful stereotypes in what they create (Bender et al., 2021). Second, training these models also brings up serious questions about copyright and who owns the data, as they often use copyrighted material without permission or giving credit. Another major issue is the spread of misinformation; very realistic 'deepfakes' and AI-written text can be used as weapons to damage public trust and control conversations. Finally, many of these complex models are not transparent, which makes it hard to hold anyone accountable or to figure out why a system made a harmful or wrong decision.

While some might say these are just tools to help human creativity, their ability to create content on their own and on a large scale presents new risks. The European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act, an important new law reaching its final stages in 2024, tackles these dangers by requiring more transparency from general-purpose AI models (European Parliament, 2024). In practice, handling these risks requires both technical fixes and better rules. Practical steps should include requiring clear records of the data used for training and how the models behave, as suggested in frameworks like the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (NIST, 2023), and using strong processes where humans review the AI's work in important situations to ensure there is real human control and accountability.
