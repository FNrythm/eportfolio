# Reflection - Collaborative Discussion 2

This discussion illuminated the tension between formal structure and adaptive flexibility in agent communication. The realization that ACLs' greatest strength—their abstraction through speech acts (Searle, 1969)—also creates their greatest weakness through ontology dependence was particularly striking.

What emerged most clearly was the evolution of the field itself. The shift from rigid, pre-defined communication protocols toward learned, emergent communication strategies (Mikolov et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2025) represents a fundamental change in how we approach multi-agent coordination. Rather than imposing structure from above, modern approaches allow agents to discover effective communication patterns through interaction and learning.

Peer feedback highlighted this transition from theory to practice, showing how contemporary research combines the intentional clarity of classical ACLs with the adaptive capabilities of modern machine learning. This suggests future multi-agent systems will need hybrid approaches—maintaining explicit communicative intent while enabling flexible, context-dependent interpretation.
