# Reflection - Collaborative Discussion 1

This discussion fundamentally shifted my understanding of computational modelling. The paradigm shift from top-down control to bottom-up emergence—where macro patterns arise from individual agent interactions—made intuitive sense when considering phenomena like traffic flow or market dynamics (Bonabeau, 2002).

The contrast between reactive and deliberative agents (Brooks, 1991; Bratman et al., 1988) highlighted a key tension in AI: whether intelligence should stem from sophisticated reasoning or simple environmental responses. Understanding that both approaches have their place reinforced the importance of matching architecture to task rather than seeking universal solutions.

Most significantly, this discussion revealed agent-based modelling's power as a decision support tool, creating virtual laboratories for testing strategies without real-world risk. However, it also raised important questions about model validation and the dangers of over-relying on simulations that may not capture all complexities.
