# Reflection on Unit 2 Seminar: EDA Tutorial

The Unit 2 seminar on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the Auto-mpg dataset provided valuable hands-on experience in data analysis techniques. Working with real-world data, I learned to identify and handle missing values, particularly in the 'horsepower' column, and discovered the importance of visualization in understanding data distribution. The practical experience with Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and seaborn enhanced my ability to create and interpret visualizations, while the process of converting categorical data to numerical representations taught me the significance of careful data preprocessing. This seminar has given me a solid foundation in EDA techniques that will be essential for future machine learning projects, emphasizing the importance of thorough data exploration before modeling.
