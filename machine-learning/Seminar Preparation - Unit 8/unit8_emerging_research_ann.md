# Unit 8 Seminar – Emerging Research in ANN

## Selected Area: Fraud Detection in Finance

After reading Mach (2021), the area that stood out most to me is fraud detection in financial services. Coming from a background in technology and customer experience, I've witnessed first-hand the pressure companies face to identify malicious behavior quickly and accurately. Neural networks (ANNs) offer a powerful tool to tackle this by learning from historical transaction data and identifying suspicious patterns with minimal human intervention. Their ability to generalize across large datasets and adapt to evolving fraud tactics makes them more effective than traditional rule-based systems.

However, the black-box nature of ANN models still presents challenges—particularly in high-stakes sectors like finance. When a customer is denied a transaction or flagged for fraud, it's critical for the institution to explain the rationale behind the decision. This creates a tension between model performance and transparency. That said, emerging techniques in explainable AI are beginning to bridge this gap.

## Concerns About AI in Personal Insurance

As a customer, my main concern lies in the potential for biased outcomes. AI systems trained on historical data may inherit past inequalities, leading to unfair pricing or access issues. For example, someone from a lower-income neighborhood might be charged higher premiums based on indirect proxies learned by the model, even if they personally represent low risk.

There's also the issue of transparency. Many customers are unaware of how their personal data is used or how pricing decisions are made. This lack of clarity could erode trust in the insurance sector if not addressed. Lastly, there's a risk of over-reliance on automation, where edge cases are handled poorly or without empathy—something that's still essential in insurance interactions.

## Team Discussion Summary

As a team, we agreed that ANNs present great promise across industries, especially for real-time, data-intensive tasks like fraud detection or image recognition. But we also acknowledged the need for regulation and model explainability, particularly in sectors impacting individual livelihoods, such as personal insurance. Striking the right balance between innovation and accountability is key.

## Learning Outcomes

- Apply and critically appraise machine learning techniques to real-world problems, particularly where technical risk and uncertainty is involved.
- Systematically develop and implement the skills required to be effective member of a development team in a virtual professional environment, adopting real-life perspectives on team roles and organisation.
