# Unit 12 Seminar â€“ Future of Machine Learning

## Selected Model Type: Predictive Machine Learning in Industry 4.0

As a team, we selected **predictive machine learning models** as the most impactful category of prognostic ML in Industry 4.0, based on the analysis by *Diez-Olivan et al. (2019)*. These models are designed to anticipate future states or events based on historical and real-time data, making them essential for proactive decision-making in complex industrial environments.

## Rationale for Selection

Predictive models strike the best balance between practical implementation and business value. Unlike descriptive models that summarize past performance or prescriptive models that suggest actions (which often require more trust and maturity), predictive models provide:

- Early warnings
- Risk forecasting
- Maintenance scheduling

All of which directly impact operational efficiency. Moreover, they are already widely deployed, making them more accessible and realistic in the near term.

## Impact in the Manufacturing Sector

In manufacturing, predictive maintenance is a standout application. ML algorithms analyze sensor data from machines to detect signs of wear, vibration anomalies, or thermal patterns. By predicting equipment failure before it happens, companies can:

- Avoid unplanned downtime
- Reduce repair costs
- Optimize maintenance cycles

However, this also introduces data governance and ethical challenges:
- Inaccurate predictions could trigger unnecessary downtime.
- If employee-related data is analyzed, privacy and surveillance concerns arise.
- Legally, responsibility becomes unclear when a prediction leads to costly actions.

## Ethical and Professional Considerations

ML professionals must address these risks through:
- Transparent model design
- Rigorous validation
- Interdisciplinary collaboration with domain experts

It's not just about accuracy. It's about trust, accountability, and understanding the operational context in which the model is deployed.
